### MySQL Management:

To manage your MySQL database:

```bash

SHOW TABLES;

# Check property count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM properties;

# Sample queries
SELECT city, COUNT(*) as count FROM properties GROUP BY city ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### Troubleshooting:

If you encounter any issues:

1. **MySQL Connection**: Ensure MySQL service is running (`brew services start mysql`)
2. **Password Issues**: Verify the password in `.env` file is correct
3. **Port Conflicts**: Check if port 3306 is available for MySQL
