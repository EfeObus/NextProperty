Emerald Ash Borer-vulnerable trees were removed, and the percentage of Sugar Maple and Red Oak was thereby increased.  All logging was by the sustainable Selection System.

Situated on approximately 39 acres with 600 ft of frontage, Darby Lane was designed by renowned architect Jack Arnold and constructed in 2005 by the present owners. This luxurious 6,000 square foot English Country Estate features 5 bedrooms and 6 bathrooms. The jaw-dropping great room, with its vaulted ceiling and custom Rumford fireplace, sets the stage for grandeur. Overlooking the great room is an opulent chef’s gourmet kitchen, equipped with luxury Viking and Bosch appliances, integrated John Boos butcher blocks, and a 12.5-foot cherry marble island with carved legs. The kitchen also boasts a walk-in pantry and a hand-shaped limestone tiled floor. Designed for entertaining, the stunning sunken dining room seats 18 and faces a private courtyard. The reclaimed local wood-clad ceiling, brick masonry wall, and custom-mounted Moet & Chandon champagne riddling racks add to the room's unique ambiance. Oversized single-hung windows envelop the room, allowing for enhanced summer dining. A mudroom with granite tiles and a private powder room with hand-shaped limestone tiles and copper sink complete the main floor. Upstairs, a generous loft overlooking the great room serves as a library and office space, offering a quiet retreat. Above the garage, an in-law or nanny suite with a separate entrance features a gas fireplace, a walk-in closet, and a 3-piece bath. The lower level, with 9-foot ceilings, hosts a bedroom, bathroom, rec room, bar, and gym. Outside, the 12’x20’ heated saltwater pool, surrounded by manicured gardens and pool house, completes this idyllic setting. Hidden just west of the residence is a 3,000 sq ft heated steel-clad building, which could serve as storage, a horse barn, or a pickleball court, providing versatility to meet various needs.Darby Lane offers an ideal retreat for those seeking a distinguished lifestyle.

Now you have the space! Not too big. Not too small. Numerous picturesque building sites are possible on this post card property.

Most recently operated as a cafe, this impressive property, with its high ceilings, updated mechanicals and ideal central location with plenty of vehicle and pedestrian traffic, offers a host of other opportunities for either an investor/landlord, or an owner/operator. Zoned C1 - General Commercial, the property is eligible for a variety of permitted uses (see documents tab for details), from business/professional office space or a medical clinic, to a bakery, or a specialty food or other retail store. For several years prior to the pandemic, the property had been home to The Garafraxa Cafe, a coffee bar/pub providing a comfortable and popular gathering place for local residents and tourists alike. The Cafe served a variety of 'lite bites', and an assortment of specialty coffees and locally crafted beers, ciders and wines. It also included a full stage, complete with a professional lighting and sound system, which regularly played host to theatrical and musical performances. For an interested buyer, this could be a turnkey opportunity to re-open the Cafe, as all of the operating assets (see list in documents file) remain on the premises and, while excluded from the listing price, are negotiable. Complementing the street level, the second floor features a spacious 3 bedroom, 1-1/2 bath apartment, flooded with natural light from 3 sides, as the property to the north is only 1 storey. The apartment has a separate entrance from the street, and a private, fenced back yard. Currently owner-occupied, it will be vacant on closing, so you can live-in, or enjoy a secondary source of rental income at market rates. This property must be seen to be fully appreciated.
