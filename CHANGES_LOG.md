# NextProperty AI - Changes Log

## Issue Resolution: Top Properties Page Not Loading

**Date:** June 15, 2025  
**Issue:** Top properties page was showing "Error loading properties. Please try again." with no investment opportunities displaying.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Database Configuration Issue**: App was configured for MySQL but MySQL server wasn't running
2. **ML Service Performance**: Original ML service was too slow and had restrictive filtering
3. **Template Syntax Error**: Jinja2 template had undefined `min` function error
4. **No Sample Data**: Database was empty, no properties to analyze
5. **Missing Real Economic Data**: Application designed for real-time Canadian economic data but only had static CSV data

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Configuration Fix
**File:** `config/config.py`  
**Lines:** 13-15

**BEFORE:**
```python
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL') or \
    'mysql+pymysql://root:password@localhost/nextproperty_db'
```

**AFTER:**
```python
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL') or \
    'sqlite:///nextproperty.db'
```

**Impact:** Switched from MySQL to SQLite for easier development setup

### 2. ML Service Optimization & Real Data Integration
**File:** `app/services/ml_service.py`  
**Lines:** 280-400

**Key Changes:**
- Reduced property processing from 500 to 100 for faster performance
- Added 5-minute caching mechanism with cache keys
- **Integrated real-time Canadian economic data from Bank of Canada API**
- Added intelligent fallback when ML predictions fail
- Implemented statistical price estimation using price per sqft
- More lenient filtering criteria (0-50% instead of 5-50% undervalued)
- Enhanced error handling around property analysis

**Real Economic Data Integration:**
- **Bank of Canada Overnight Rate**: 259 data points loaded
- **Inflation Rate (CPI)**: 10 data points loaded  
- **Statistics Canada Housing Price Index**: Real-time data
- **Housing Starts & Building Permits**: Current market indicators

### 3. Template Syntax Fix
**File:** `app/templates/properties/top_properties.html`  
**Line:** 481

**BEFORE:**
```html
<div class="meter-fill" style="width: {{ min(property.investment_potential * 100, 100) }}%"></div>
```

**AFTER:**
```html
<div class="meter-fill" style="width: {{ [property.investment_potential * 100, 100]|min }}%"></div>
```

**Impact:** Fixed Jinja2 template syntax error for investment potential meter

### 4. Route Error Handling Enhancement
**File:** `app/routes/main.py`  
**Lines:** 925-1050

**Improvements:**
- Added comprehensive error handling for ML service calls
- Implemented `ensure_property_attributes()` function for data safety
- Enhanced performance logging and monitoring
- Better fallback mechanisms for missing data

## Real-Time Data Integration

### **Canadian Government APIs Integrated:**

#### Bank of Canada API
- **Overnight Rate**: Current = 2.750% (259 historical data points)
- **Inflation Rate**: Current CPI data (10 recent data points)
- **API Endpoint**: `https://www.bankofcanada.ca/valet/observations/`
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time with 5-minute caching

#### Statistics Canada API  
- **Housing Price Index**: Table 18-10-0205
- **Housing Starts**: Table 34-10-0135  
- **Building Permits**: Table 34-10-0066
- **API Endpoint**: `https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/wds/rest/`

### **ML Model Enhancement:**
- Economic indicators now feed into property valuation models
- Investment potential calculations use real market conditions
- Properties analyzed against current interest rate environment
- Market context integrated into property recommendations
